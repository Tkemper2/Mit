# Cars

## 3D-design
We have designed our cars using the software [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.fr/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription). The cars are composed of electronics, 3d printed parts and lego pieces. The first step was to import all the components into Fusion 360. For the electronic components, we have downloaded some existing models, listed below:

>- [ESP8266 board]()
>- [ESP32-CAM board]()
>- [L298N motor driver]()
>- [Motor]()
>- [Servo]()
